# Beau Segal <br>
This is the first website I have ever created and incorporates a multitude of different features and APIs. The site uses PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs such as lazy loaders and Google analytics. <br>
As this is the first website is unorganized, but many different files incorporated my though process when creating different features. I was able to create this site with little knowledge of programming and it taught me how I should create websites in the future to avoid many of the problems I came across.
### Live version of the website <br/>
[Beau Segal site]( https://beausegal.xyz/)
### Versions
V0: contains basic ideas I had when first starting. Most of which has been overhauled </br>
V0.5-1.5: have been omitted to simplify this repository </br>
V2: Current Live version of the site </br>
### Structure
-	Root: Contains all the PHP code as well as CSS and JS. This is bad practice and future projects have focused on organization. Interesting files are *searchBar.php* and *createAccount.php* 
-	Root\Users: User accounts that are generated have images stored here in monolithic fashion
-	Root\ProfilePictures: All user profile pictures are stored here
-	Root\mainArt: Icons and carousel images are stored here
-	Root\backgrounds: Backgrounds for the site are stored here
## Improvements â€“ Three things I could have done differently for major improvements
1.	Separate PHP, JS, CSS, and HTML pages to their own folders
2.	Rewrite entire site in MVC pattern with PHP to reuse code effectively and add security
3.	Offload Root\Users,\ProfilePictures,\mainArt,\backgrounds to cloud services such as AWS S3
